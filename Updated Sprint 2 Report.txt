What's New:
 - Leaderboard hooked up to firebase
 - Google O'Auth Login
 - Workout Tracker
 - Workout Cards (social media aspect)
 - Partially integrated Figma
 - Developed UI for workout tracker page and settings page


 Work Summary
 Our team built off of what we had earlier in our prototype stage, developing crucial backend improvements like a login flow (Google O’Auth -> username selection -> main page), added a “Feed” which has the public leaderboard (hooked up to Firebase), workout cards, and the gym check-in button from earlier. We incorporated a workout tracker to track workout information (separate of the main page).


Retrospective:


What went well:
We were able to complete a bunch of features and integrate crucial backend + frontend stuff. We did better at splitting up the work between our group members and ensuring each finished tasks.


What we’d like to improve:
We would like to meet more often and stay on the same page: and hold everyone accountable to completing tasks earlier than deadlines so we stay ahead. We’d like to make sure everyone stays active and available


Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
We would like to meet more often (3 times a week) and implement more features in the first two weeks of the sprint, so we don’t have to rush in the final two and create a higher quality final product.

What's New (User Facing)
 - Mock leaderboard feature
 - Gym Check-in geolocation feature
 - Workout social widget
 - UI Figma prepared


Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Our team created a barebones foundation for what minimal viable product functionality looks like in our application. We added a mock-leaderboard with currently hardcoded data to simulate users, a workout social widget to demonstrate how the social/sharing aspect of workouts will work, and a gym check-in feature to get users comfortable with that concept. The check-in button detects whether the user is within 200m of the gym (currently hardcoded to student recreation center), and if so, allows check-in to proceed. These features were our main focus for the first sprint, as we believed them to be our MVP features. On the user interface side, we developed a full-on user interface for all functionality in Figma, following color palettes and incorporating functionality derived from surveys conducted on numerous real gym-goers. We realized in the sprint that we overloaded too many resources (two people) on UI and had to overcome the barrier of duplicate work being done. Throughout the sprint, we learned how to work synchronously and asynchronously, and had to overcome the barrier of communicating the work being done by improving means of communication. We learned to harness Discord as a centralized means of communication with various logs to keep track of our work (paired with the Kanban board, of course). We also battled learning new frameworks like Flutter which none of us were familiar with, which took a long time, but through collaboration we overcame this problem.


Unfinished Work
We had a few issues that were not main priorities for sprint one, which can get pushed to sprint 2. These issues include User Login & Account Access, Streak Check-In, New User Account Setup, and hooking up a backend. We choose to focus on fleshing out our UI and refining the front-facing parts of the for this spring so that we would have a clear vision going forward.

Retrospective Summary


Here's what went well:


Changes to our workflow by communicating more and delegating work better helped a lot in streamlining the process.
Harnessing Discord to keep track of various things like AI-usage and key resources was helpful, especially as all of us are familiar with it.
Meetings at least twice weekly over Discord voice call helped a lot, and regrouping after lecture to discuss where our next direction is.


Here's what we'd like to improve:


We’d like to stay on pace even when midterms or personal events occur
We’d like to ensure everyone shows up on time to our meetings so we have a clear picture of production
We’d like to have clearer documentation/logging of work produced.
Preventing duplicate work by delegating better and having clearer communication.


Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:


Planning around future unavoidable events like midterms and other personal events better would be helpful so we can consistently stay on pace.
Plan out meetings better, and make sure everyone shows up on time. This would help prevent time wasted waiting and ensure efficiency.
Document our work, changes, and media better for clearer logging of work produced and challenges faced.
Meet even more frequently, and allocate more resources to backend development instead of user interface development (especially crucial for prototyping phase).
